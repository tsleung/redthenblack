**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Prepared for:** Red then Black Startup Team

**Prepared by:** Senior Product Manager


This document outlines a comprehensive product development plan and Product Requirements Document (PRD) for "Red then Black," a personalized algorithmic financial strategy platform.  It addresses the initial feedback and notes provided, focusing on a phased approach to maximize impact and minimize risk for a startup environment.


**I. Executive Summary:**

Red then Black aims to empower individuals, particularly software engineers, to make informed financial decisions through sophisticated yet accessible simulation and analysis tools.  The initial focus will be on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) centered around equity compensation modeling, followed by expansion into other financial domains.  A freemium model will drive user acquisition and generate revenue through premium features and increased compute/storage capacity.


**II. Problem & Solution:**

**Problem:**  Many individuals, especially those in the tech industry, struggle to effectively manage complex financial situations involving equity compensation, real estate investments, and long-term retirement planning. Existing tools are either too simplistic or too complex, lacking the personalized modeling and scenario planning capabilities needed for informed decision-making.  Misinformation and scams further exacerbate the problem.

**Solution:** Red then Black provides a user-friendly platform that leverages algorithmic modeling (Monte Carlo simulations, Markov Decision Processes) to offer personalized financial strategies.  The platform will offer:

* **Accessible Simulations:**  Intuitive interface allowing users to input their financial data and run simulations with varying parameters.
* **Personalized Insights:**  Clear visualizations and reports that highlight potential outcomes, risks, and opportunities.
* **Educational Content:**  Free resources to improve financial literacy and combat misinformation.
* **Scalable Infrastructure:**  A robust backend capable of handling complex simulations and large datasets.
* **Community Features (Future):**  A moderated forum for users to share experiences and learn from each other.


**III. Target Audience:**

The initial target audience is software engineers and tech professionals. This group is:

* **Tech-Savvy:**  Comfortable with data-driven decision-making and complex tools.
* **Financially Literate (Potentially):**  Possessing some understanding of financial concepts, but needing guidance on complex scenarios.
* **High-Value Users:**  Often possessing significant equity compensation and investment capital.


**IV. Product Vision & Mission:**

**Vision:** To create a world where everyone can confidently plan their financial future using powerful, accessible tools and reliable information.

**Mission:** To empower individuals with data-driven insights and educational resources to make optimal financial decisions, reducing risk and maximizing long-term success.
