**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Prepared for:** Red then Black Startup Team

**Prepared by:** Senior Product Manager


This document outlines a comprehensive product development plan and Product Requirements Document (PRD) for "Red then Black," a financial planning platform leveraging algorithmic simulations.  The plan prioritizes rapid iteration, user feedback, and a phased approach to feature development, focusing initially on a core user group and value proposition.


**I. Executive Summary:**

Red then Black addresses the critical need for accessible and accurate financial planning tools, particularly for tech-savvy individuals facing complex financial decisions. The platform will offer a freemium model, providing free access to basic educational content and simulations while offering premium features for advanced analysis and increased computational power.  The initial focus will be on the "Equity Compensation Pack," targeting software engineers, followed by expansion to other financial domains.


**II. Problem & Solution:**

**Problem:**  Many individuals, especially those in the tech industry, lack the tools and knowledge to effectively manage complex financial situations like equity compensation, real estate investments, and retirement planning. Existing solutions (spreadsheets, basic calculators) are inadequate for sophisticated modeling and scenario planning.  Misinformation and scams further complicate the landscape.

**Solution:** Red then Black provides a user-friendly platform combining algorithmic simulations, educational content, and a supportive community to empower users to make informed financial decisions.  The platform's core strength lies in its ability to run Monte Carlo simulations, allowing users to visualize the range of possible outcomes and make data-driven choices.


**III. Target Audience:**

The initial target audience is software engineers (4 million in the US), a group known for its technical proficiency and high earning potential.  This focused approach allows for targeted marketing and streamlined feature development.  Future expansion will target broader tech workers and eventually millennials.


**IV. Value Proposition:**

Red then Black offers a unique combination of:

* **Power & Precision:**  Advanced simulations provide more accurate financial projections than traditional methods.
* **Accessibility:**  User-friendly interface makes complex financial concepts understandable.
