When there is a recommendation to buy an asset, the suitability is seldom considered, and the assumptions aren't transparent and are misleading. I want to build a community of people who can discuss, using transparent methods, the validity and efficacy of different approaches to life planning.\n\n\nI am building calculators to help people plan for their life. These calculators use simulation and analysis methods, combined with educational material and articles, to help people plan. How can I be more successful? Is it possible to get help? What would a good division of responsibilities for myself, and one part time person, to get help building my project \"Red then Black\" look like? Help me create a project plan and timeline. It is more important to build a large following, then convert them to customers whom pay for compute and storage (not education) for the simulator and analysis environment. So all features can be run in the users browser, simulation within their local device and storage (local storage I think may not work, will look at PWA and larger solutions) but I'll create a model exporter for them to save/load. To avoid having to use their local device for storage (makes it easier to just login) or compute (can use a cloud service to run massively in parallel) thats where a premium feature I think will be good - because I need to cover compute and storage costs.\n\nI created user accounts which allow people to share a simulation they've been working on. I'm unsure of the direction to go, if I should allow commenting or just allow it to be embeded / screenshotted to be shared so social media so I can avoid community management. I think there is a subtle desire to share and request feedback - life planning is a social experience amongst family, friends, or a generation (gen z is very public with their personal information). I believe this is a value differentiator and builds collective wisdom, similar to the academic community publishing papers. Community management is difficult though, with scammers/spam and technical issues that are introduced which may be overwhelming for a small team and for me to build a product without much revenue, if I'm focusing on giving away as much as possible for free.\n\nI created a lightweight simulator following an entity component system, so it can be composed with different systems like mortgages, debts, sending kids to college, job switches, etc.\n\nHere is the one page pitch: ```Red then Black\nPersonalized Algorithmic Financial Strategy\nProblem\nRetirement planning uses inappropriate approximations where details matter, most notably 8-10% market returns. Prolonged ignorance and lack of education exacerbates the problem, causing either (1) a direct negative impact to financial health or (2) inactivity and time out of the market ensuring retirement goals cannot be achieved within a lifetime. \n\nSpecifically facing this problem are millennials, many who have faced two economic recessions, suffer from student loan debt, and are trying to build families and take care of their aging parents. The decisions they make today will drastically affect their future, near and into retirement. Tools are required to evaluate suitability of different options. \n\nTools exist for specific domains - mortgage lenders provide mortgage calculators, investment institutions provide crude estimates of annual compounded returns with their products. The holistic integration tool of the specific domains doesn\u2019t exist.\nSolution\nAlgorithmic solutions exist for specific financial problems given assumptions. Two straightforward methods of modeling decisions and simulated outcomes are (1) markov decision processes and (2) monte carlo analysis. Developing heuristics for suitable solutions may be achieved through reinforcement learning and understandable models such as lookup tables or decision trees. \n\nProblem frameworks may be devised with suitable parameters specified. Utility theory provides a nomenclature for non engineers to describe the \u2018bit flips\u2019 of their life, modeling decisions to make and tradeoffs expected. Understandable models provide resistance to behavioral biases and improved adherence.\n\nRelatively basic algorithms can provide significant advantages in holistically exploring the probabilistic space for an individual at low cost. Further a standardized parameter set enables enlightened conversation across individuals and with financial professionals.\n\nRed then Black (RtB) offers suitable financial strategies by applying algorithms to personalized circumstances.\n \nTraction\nGoogle has 130k employees who should allegedly embrace algorithmic methods applied to financial planning.

Improved user experience will open access to this market and beyond.\n\nSoftware engineers have general acceptance for the methods being pursued in the solution being provided.

Software engineers are generally price insensitive to low cost solutions that provide significant impact to their personal bottom line.\nCompetition\nSpreadsheets.

That\u2019s great but how? How much?\n<sampled backtest>\n<historical backtest>\n\nBased on historical returns, we can generate some sample investments, either a historical run or sampled.\n\nIf we don\u2019t invest we can expect to keep our balance the same. Increasing your bet increases the difference between the lowest/highest returns and also the average return. Continually increasing your bet will continue to increase the difference between the lowest/highest returns, but then decrease your average return back to where you started, then eventually to zero.\n\n[Aside] Intuitively if you had a deck of cards where 51 of the 52 cards are in your favour, how much of your money should you bet? If nothing, you\u2019re wasting the opportunity. If everything, if you hit the 1 of the 52 cards not in your favour, you\u2019ll be wiped out. The answer is somewhere in the middle, but not everything.\n\nImportance of Cash\n\nMarket strategy for retirement\nThe only mistake is to overbet\n\nThe US stock market has historically returned 10% per year. How much should you bet on it?\nWhat are normal returns https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhYHrHiOS_E \n\nA rule of thumb is 100 minus age in equities, the rest in bonds. Most 401k plans offer target date funds, which are fundamentally a set of equities and bonds roughly designed around the same rule. As someone fast approaching the 35 age bracket, I would be 100 - 35, 65% in stocks and 35% in bonds.\n\nLet\u2019s explore why this works, so we know how we can make it better. We\u2019ll use the S&P 500, 20 year treasury bonds, and a deck of cards.\n\nIn the past 16 years we have roughly 4000 trading days, or data points, to work with. There are many reasons financial professionals will suggest bonds. The reason I care about them is over the course of that time, bonds have remained negatively correlated to moves in equities. Furthermore they tend to correlate more negatively when equities are losing in value, providing value and reducing losses. \n\nWhy do we care?

During COVID i watched a lot of friends make speculative investing decisions which in many cases didn't work out as intended. As the rise of retail traders occured, i can't help but sense the same fate will affect many more people. This is to raise awareness of the pitfalls of investing and how to build confidence in the decisions you'll make, even if the outcome doesn't necessarily go your way 5000 dollars may make a difference, but so can 5000 words.\n\nAbout the author. Investing for yourself is personal. My name is Terran, I have no professional experience in finance or academic degrees in computer science. Like a lot of people, looking back when I started my career a little over ten years ago, I would\u2019ve known more about the compensation for why we work and what that means for our income, wealth, and utility. While there are a million resources out there telling people what to do with their money, I honestly found the simplest mechanics are usually the most correct but glossed over. Through COVID a lot of friends, family, and colleagues lost money and panic followed on the way down and fear on the way up. There was a surge of retail traders and there was an article of a suicide. The purpose of writing this article is to demonstrate the personal nature of your own financial planning and leveraging simple mechanics to make the most of the limited resources that we have and additionally elaborate on the risks.\n\n\nInternal notes\n\n\nYou\u2019re given an opportunity to bet on a coin flip, what do you do?\n\nHow much do you bet?\n\nWhat do we know about this coin?\n\n\nWhen do we switch from 3x to 1x - how can we graph the change in returns (how much are we losing being in the leveraged etf?)\nHow do we know when to short? Do we look at VIX, RSI?\nHow do we know when to go to cash? Do we look at VIX?\nHow do we know when to sell? Sell high, buy never. Gives up extra gains via momentum, that's about it\nHow do we know when to buy? Momentum shields on the way down, don't buy into a losing asset if possible - we should MC to find out when the ideal reversion/purchase time is\nFixed fees (expense ratios .95%, short borrowing fee .75% to short) vs volatility (7% move on a day tradeoff)\nRebalancing is very difficult - it's when and what\n\nKalman filter - how loss averse are you? Given a series of bets - lets create a curve\nThis can be your current net wealth against the bets you\u2019re willing to take\n\n\u201c\nThere are a lot of unknowns in financial markets, and oftentimes, it is tempting to try and go for the one size fits all solution to try and reduce the dissonance.  While for most people this may work reasonably well, there is a central concept in financial planning around \"suitability\", i.e: whether a particular financial plan is suitable for an individual based on their personal situation.  This, I feel, is something that is lacking in many discussions in our forums.\n\nIf the recent roller coaster ride in the markets did not bother you in the slightest, then you can probably ignore this.  But if the recent volatility in the markets gave you sleepless nights, then consider reevaluating your premise, and try to poke holes in your investment thesis.  If your plan doesn't stand up to scrutiny, maybe you should rethink some things.\n\nFinally, if all these sound like way too much work, consider getting professional help.  Financial advice doesn't come cheap, but ~1% of assets per year is a cheaper price to pay, then if you had panicked and sold at the bottom of the Covid-19 crash.  Just be sure that you properly vet the advisor, and ensure that the fee structure aligns their interests with yours.\n\n\u201d Direct quote from JB https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/d/msgid/investing/CAFPm-MP_dPL4o0NXdjFxY74X1WTBXz8CoqqWpKiPZ_Zyk7ttHQ%40mail.gmail.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer \n\n\n\nredthenblack.com\nredthanblack.com\nredderthanblack.com\nblackerthanred.com\nredderthan.black\nblackerthan.red\nredblackmc.com\nredblackcm.com\nredblackrm.com\nredblacktrading.com\nredblackinvesting.com\nmontecarloinvesting.com\n\nredtoblack.com $7k\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your bet?\u201d\n\nA red card faces you, 51 cards face down to the side.
