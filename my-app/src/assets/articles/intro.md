# Intro

If there is only one thing you read/watch/listen to here, it should be ["Victor Haghani - Optimal Bet Sizing (YouTube)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NC12DhaFV8#t=1m4s). My hope is you will takeaway:
1. Even with favorable circumstances, most lose money
2. Geometric mean trumps arithmentic mean for compounding returns over a long series of bets
3. There is a misconception increased risk leads to increase rewards. Excessive risk instead minimizes rewards

The remaining resources provide education to determine the optimal bet size for your circumtances. Acknowledge beating the market is hard, so invest in the market. Many of the resources will describe what it means to 'invest in the market' - even if there isn't much consensus of what the market is. SP500? DOW? NASDAQ? Top 100, 500, 1000, 3000 companies? Should the weighting be market cap, share price, equal? Normalized by sector, by industry, or market capitalization? If I buy 100 stocks that are correlated, why doesn't that count as diversification? Why would I buy gold/treasuries/volatility when most of the time they lose money? If the optimal bet size is >100%, does that make leverage okay?
