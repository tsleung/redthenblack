# Gas vs. Electric Cars Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs) as a way to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. However, EVs are still more expensive than gas-powered cars, so it is important to carefully consider the financial implications of buying an EV before making a decision.

One way to compare the financial costs of a gas car and an EV is to use discounted cash flow analysis (DCF). DCF is a financial modeling technique that takes into account the time value of money to calculate the present value of future cash flows. This allows us to compare the total cost of ownership of a gas car and an EV over a period of time, taking into account factors such as the initial purchase price, fuel costs, maintenance costs, and resale value.

The following is a simplified DCF analysis of the financial costs of a gas car and an EV:

## Gas Car

- Initial purchase price: $25,000
- Fuel costs: $2,000 per year
- Maintenance costs: $1,000 per year
- Resale value: $15,000 after 5 years
## EV

- Initial purchase price: $35,000
- Fuel costs: $500 per year
- Maintenance costs: $1,000 per year
- Resale value: $20,000 after 5 years

Assuming a discount rate of 5%, the NPV of the gas car over 5 years is $11,715. The NPV of the EV over 5 years is $10,295. This means that, in this simplified example, the gas car has a slightly higher NPV than the EV.

However, it is important to note that this is just a simplified example. In reality, there are many other factors that can affect the financial costs of a gas car and an EV, such as the cost of electricity, the availability of charging stations, and the tax incentives that are available for EVs.

It is also important to consider the impact of inflation, energy prices, and other risks on the financial costs of a gas car and an EV. For example, if inflation increases, the cost of fuel will also increase, which will make the gas car more expensive to operate. Conversely, if energy prices decrease, the cost of electricity will also decrease, which will make the EV more affordable.

Overall, DCF analysis is a useful tool for comparing the financial costs of a gas car and an EV. However, it is important to consider all of the relevant factors before making a decision.

## Additional Considerations

In addition to the financial costs, there are other factors that you may want to consider when choosing between a gas car and an EV. These include:

- The environmental impact of each type of vehicle. EVs produce zero emissions, while gas cars emit greenhouse gases.
- The availability of charging stations. If you live in an area with limited access to charging stations, an EV may not be a good option for you.
- The tax incentives that are available for EVs. In some countries, there are government incentives that can make EVs more affordable.
Ultimately, the decision of whether to buy a gas car or an EV is a personal one. You should weigh all of the relevant factors and decide what is best for you.
