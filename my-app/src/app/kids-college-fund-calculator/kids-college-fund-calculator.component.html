# Saving for a Kid's College Fund

College is expensive. The average cost of tuition and fees at a four-year public college in the United States is now over $10,000 per year. And that doesn't even include room and board, books, and other expenses.

If you want to help your child afford college, you need to start saving early. The sooner you start, the more time your money has to grow.

There are a number of different ways to save for college. You can open a savings account, invest in a 529 plan, or even start a college savings plan through your employer.

The best way to save for college depends on your individual circumstances. But if you want to take a quantitative approach, there are a few things you need to consider.

## 1. How much will college cost?

The first step is to estimate how much college will cost by the time your child is ready to attend. You can use a college cost calculator to get an estimate.

## 2. How much can you afford to save?

Once you know how much college will cost, you need to figure out how much you can afford to save. This will depend on your income, expenses, and other financial goals.

## 3. What is the best savings vehicle?

There are a number of different savings vehicles available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. You need to choose the one that is right for you.

## 4. How much should you save each month?

The amount you save each month will depend on your income, expenses, and other financial goals. But a good rule of thumb is to save at least 10% of your income for college.

## 5. What about financial aid?

Don't forget about financial aid when you are planning for college. There are a number of different financial aid programs available, and you may be eligible for some of them.
