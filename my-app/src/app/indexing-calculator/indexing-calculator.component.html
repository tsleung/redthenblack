  # Index Investing: A Low-Cost, Diversified, and Easy Way to Grow Your Money
  Index investing is a passive investment strategy that seeks to replicate the returns of a benchmark index. Index funds are baskets of securities that track a specific index, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Index funds are typically much cheaper than actively managed funds, and they offer a simple and easy way to invest in the market.
  
  ## Benefits of Index Investing
  There are many benefits to index investing, including:
  
  - **Low costs:** Index funds are typically much cheaper than actively managed funds. This is because index funds do not have to pay for expensive research and trading costs.
  - **Diversification:** Index funds offer a diversified way to invest in the market. This is because they track a specific index, which includes a basket of securities.
  - **Ease of use:** Index funds are easy to use. You can buy and sell them just like any other stock or mutual fund.
  - **Potential for long-term growth:** Over the long term, the stock market has historically trended upwards. This means that index funds have the potential to grow your money over time.
  
  ## Mortgaging Your Retirement
  In their paper "Mortgaging Your Retirement," Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff argue that the traditional advice to invest conservatively in your retirement years is too conservative. They recommend that young investors borrow money to invest in stocks, and then pay off the debt as they get older.
  
  They argue that this strategy will lead to higher returns in retirement, because stocks have historically outperformed bonds over the long term. They also argue that this strategy will reduce the risk of running out of money in retirement, because it will allow investors to take advantage of the power of compounding interest.
  
  However, it is important to note that this strategy is not without risk. If the stock market declines significantly, investors could end up owing more money than they have in their retirement accounts.
  
  Overall, Ayres and Nalebuff's strategy is a risky one, but it could potentially lead to higher returns in retirement. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before deciding whether or not to adopt this strategy.
  
  ## Conclusion
  Index investing is a great way to invest in the stock market. It is a low-cost, diversified, and easy-to-use way to grow your money over time. "Mortgaging Your Retirement" is a risky strategy that involves taking out a loan against your retirement savings.
  
  The best strategy for you will depend on your individual circumstances and risk tolerance. If you are not sure which strategy is right for you, you should speak to a financial advisor.
