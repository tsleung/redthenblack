    <span> 
      When making investment decisions, it is important to be able to compare the different cash flows that each investment option generates. The quantitative approach to comparing cash flows uses a variety of methods to assess the relative value of different investments.

      One of the most common methods is net present value (NPV). NPV is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of an investment to their present value. The discount rate used is the investor's required rate of return. If the NPV of an investment is positive, then the investment is expected to generate a return that is greater than the investor's required rate of return. Conversely, if the NPV is negative, then the investment is expected to generate a return that is less than the investor's required rate of return.
