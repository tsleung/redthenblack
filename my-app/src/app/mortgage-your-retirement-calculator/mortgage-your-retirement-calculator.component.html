  # Mortgaging Your Retirement

  In their paper "Mortgaging Your Retirement," Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff argue that traditional retirement planning advice is too conservative. They propose a new strategy called "lifecycle investing," which involves using leverage to invest more heavily in stocks when you are young and then paying down the debt as you get older.
  
  The authors support their argument with historical data. They show that a leveraged investment strategy has outperformed a traditional strategy in the long run. They also show that the leveraged strategy is less risky than it might seem. This is because the longer you invest in stocks, the more likely you are to see a positive return.
  
  Of course, there is no guarantee that the leveraged strategy will work in the future. However, the authors argue that it is a better bet than the traditional strategy. They also point out that the leveraged strategy is relatively easy to implement. You can simply buy stocks on margin using a brokerage account.
  
  Here are some of the key points of the article:
  
  - Traditional retirement planning advice is too conservative.
  - A leveraged investment strategy can help you achieve a higher retirement nest egg with less risk.
  - The leveraged strategy is less risky than it might seem because the longer you invest in stocks, the more likely you are to see a positive return.
  - The leveraged strategy is relatively easy to implement.
  
  ## Lifecycle Investing
  
  The conventional wisdom for retirement investing is to start out with a mix of stocks and bonds, and then gradually shift to more bonds as you get older. However, Ayres and Nalebuff argue that this strategy is too conservative and can lead to you ending up with less money in retirement.
  
  They propose a different strategy called "lifecycle investing," which involves using leverage to invest more heavily in stocks when you are young and then paying down the debt as you get older. This strategy takes advantage of the fact that stocks tend to be more volatile over the short term, but they also have a higher long-term return. By using leverage, you can increase your exposure to stocks when they are cheap, which can help you to earn a higher return over the long term.
  
  Ayres and Nalebuff argue that lifecycle investing is a more efficient way to diversify your portfolio across time. They use a Monte Carlo simulation to show that lifecycle investing can produce significantly higher returns than a traditional stock-bond mix, even when the stock market experiences a major crash.
  
  They also argue that lifecycle investing is less risky than it appears. Because you are paying down the debt as you get older, you are less likely to be forced to sell your stocks at a loss in retirement. In fact, they show that lifecycle investing can actually reduce your risk of ending up with too little money in retirement.
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  Lifecycle investing is a more aggressive investment strategy that is best suited for people who are comfortable with risk. However, it can be a very effective way to achieve a higher retirement nest egg with less risk. If you are considering using lifecycle investing, you should carefully consider your individual circumstances and consult with a financial advisor.
  
  Here are some additional points that are worth mentioning:
  
  Lifecycle investing is not for everyone. It is a more aggressive investment strategy that is best suited for people who are comfortable with risk.
  You should carefully consider your individual circumstances before deciding whether or not to use lifecycle investing.
  There are other investment strategies that can also be effective for retirement planning. You should consult with a financial advisor to find the strategy that is right for you.
